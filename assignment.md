# Allow user to add/update the cart

## on header, display a cart icon with a counter

## when user clicks on Bag It button, the item should be added to the cart (tip- use mongodb to add to a collection referenced by userid)

## if the item already exists in cart and user adds it again, the quantity should be increased

## when user clicks the cart icon, they should see the list of bagged items along with quantity and total price

## on cart page user should be able to remove an item from cart or change quantity.
